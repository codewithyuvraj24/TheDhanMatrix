# ⚡ Dhanmatrixcapital: Premium UI Polish & Standards

## ✅ Accomplished
1. **GitHub Community Standards**: Validated `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` (Bug Report & Feature Request) to ensure repo professionalism matching the `README.md`.
2. **Premium Interface Logic**:
   - **Dashboard**: Upgraded all primary actions ("Export", "Schedule Investment", "Add First Investment", "Modal Actions") to use Physics-Based `MagneticButton`s.
   - **Live Indication**: Implemented a "Pulsing" animation for the "Protocol Active" status indicator to make the dashboard feel alive.
   - **AI Widget**: Upgraded usage instructions to be interactive with `MagneticButton`.
3. **Verification**: Successfully built the application (`npm run build`) to ensure type safety and no regressions.
4. **Admin Panel**: Verified that the Admin Command Center maintains the same high visual standard.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- **Matrix Core Integration**: Verify the Python backend connection.
- **Deep Accessibility**: Run a full audit (Axe/Lighthouse).
